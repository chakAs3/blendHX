Notes for myself:

beta v0506
---------------------------------
✓ Load IMAP error : Registered All loaded class aliases, seemed EventDispatcher event Map list was the problem. The list of classes to be minimized later. 
✓ Material Class alias load error
✓ Rename game objects
✓ Rename assets
✓ Scripts panel
✓ Material panel
✓ play/edit mode
✓ export
✓ Editor grid
✓ delete used asset, error
✓ add script could wrongly add a shader, check
✓ reparent camera
✓ Undo/Redo
	✓ Keyboard shortcuts:
	✓ ProjectUndoCommand
	✓ ProjectRedoCommand
	✓ EntityDeleteCommand
	✓ EntityRenameCommand
	✓ AssetsRenameCommand
	✓ ProjectReloadScriptsCommand
	✓ ProjectPlayModeCommand
	✓ ProjectHelpCommand
	✓ ProjectEditModeCommand
	✓ ProjectSaveCommand
	✓ Material, Script change undo
	✓ Play/Edit mode, does not support undo because entities are loaded from clone, should be reversed


Known issues:
✓ ! Component enable/disable initialize/uninitialize check with script (it works with sound atm)
! rename texture is not reflected in a material
! Context3D un-recoverably lost
property panels dispatch update model twice it seems, check
Transform component should be revised to something standard, or simply make sure it is not made-up now. Transform supports only one level of parent to translate the position
Command undo/redo might cause a problem when another commands is added in between
Camera does not resize itself unless the editor is resized once
On play/edit mode and load entities are initialized/uninitialized so many times, why?!
✓ collapse in hierarchy support undo(needed really?)(It does not)
✓ selected object highlight (Gimos indicate selection)
